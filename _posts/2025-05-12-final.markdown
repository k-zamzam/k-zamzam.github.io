## Introduction
Parking citations is a part of everyday life even in San Francisco. However, when you begin to look at where they are distributed and the amount of revenue they generate, it raises some questions.

Are tickets distributed unequally throughout the city, or are some neighbourhoods facing a heavier burden than others? And who ultimately pays the highest cost?

In this project, we’re examining the distribution of parking citations throughout San Francisco and if there’s a correlation to income levels. We will examine the revenue generated by these fines and identify the sources of that money.

# About the data
This analysis is based on a dataset of parking citations issued by the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency (SFMTA). The dataset contains millions of records and includes information such as the date, time, location, violation description, and fine amount for each citation.

We use a subset of the data that covers a time span from 2019 to present, allowing us to examine trends in parking enforcement. It also includes geographic data (like neighbourhoods and latitude/longitude), which makes it possible to visualize the distribution of tickets across the city.

## Which neighborhoods are most targeted?

From the map shown in Figure 1, it is clear that parking enforcement in San Francisco is far from evenly distributed. A couple of neighborhoods stand out immediately. Leading the list across recent years are the Mission, Financial District/South Beach, and Tenderloin. 

The Financial District is filled with office buildings and business traffic, which most likely explains the higher number of issued tickets. On the other hand, the Mission and Tenderloin tell a different story. These are home to many working-class resident, and in the case of Tenderloin, some of the highest poverty rates in the city [[1]].

This is where it gets interesting. From 2019 to the present, the Mission alone has seen over 690,000 citations, while Tenderloin has received around 387,000. These are the neighborhoods where parking tickets might weigh heavier, as a fine might not just be annoying but can become a financial burden for residents.

A recent study on the relationship between neighborhood income and parking citations across 16 US cities including San Fransisco found that low-income areas are consistently tickets more heavily than others [[2]].

## Most common parking violation

To understand how and when parking enforcement affects San Francisco residents, we began by identifying the most commonly issued parking citation types. As shown in Figure 2, street cleaning violations dominate the top 10, making up 45% of all citations issued. This finding is consistent with Wo et al. (2023) [[3]], who report that nearly 40% of all citations citywide are issued for street cleaning violations.

In the interactive visualization shown in Figure 3, shows that street cleaning is by far the most common violation type in Mission and Tenderloin. However, in Financial District/South Beach, street cleaning ranks second, while parking meter violations occur nearly twice as often. This may be due to the large number of metered parking zones in the Financial District, which are primarily intended for business use.

# Street cleaning enforcement Hours in Mission and Tenderloin

The nature of street cleaning enforcement makes it especially likely to affect residents. According to [[3]], these citations are typically issued during late night to early morning hours, and are more likely to be received by people who live in the area because they fail to move their vehicle in time. In particular, it is stated that residents may be asleep, working, or otherwise unable to move their vehicles when street cleaning rules take effect.

We examined this dynamic more closely in Mission and Tenderloin, two neighborhoods with high citation volumes and relatively lower average incomes. In Figure 4, the Tenderloin shows a sharp peak at 6am, indicating a highly concentrated window of enforcement. The Mission displays a more distributed pattern between 6am and 10am, with additional activity around midnight. These timings suggest that enforcement hits residents during periods when flexibility is limited.
While [[3]] does not directly measure off-street parking availability, it does show that low-income neighborhoods have fewer public on-street spaces on average compared to higher-income ones, which may increase residents’ reliance on street parking and their exposure to timed restrictions.

## Who pays the price?
Parking citations generate serious income for San Francisco. Tickets issued from 2022 onward have brought in over $374 million in fines. That’s a massive amount—especially considering that one specific violation, street cleaning, accounting for 42.6% of all citations.

This money doesn’t come equally from all neighborhoods. Our graph shows that places like the Mission and Tenderloin which also appear among the most cited areas contribute some of the highest total revenues from fines. These are also neighborhoods where residents are more likely to depend on street parking and have fewer resources to pay these costs.

Wo et al. [[3]] have described this kind of system as “taxation by citation”—a way cities raise money that can unfairly target people with fewer alternatives. When lower-income areas are both the most cited and the biggest contributors to fine revenue, the lines between enforcement and inequality start to blur.

## Conclusion
Parking violations happen for different reasons in different parts of the city. In the Financial District, it’s likely due to business traffic, while in the Mission and Tenderloin, it reflects the daily lives of people who live and work there. Looking at when and where tickets are given tells us a lot about how each neighborhood functions.
